I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you no other will do

I've lost all ambition for wordly acclaim
I just want to be the one you'd love
And with your admission that you'd feel the same
I'll have reach the goal I'm dreaming of believe me
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart

(I've lost all ambition for wordly acclaim)
I just want to be the one you'd love
(And with your admission could you'd feel the same)
I'll have reach the goal I'm dreaming of believe me
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
