I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
In my heart I have but one desire
And that one is you, no other will do
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
I don't want to set the world on fire, honey
I love you too much
I just want to start a great big flame down in your heart
You see, way down deep inside of me, darling
I have only one desire
And that one desire is you
And I know, baby, ain't nobody else gonna do
I've lost all ambition for worldly acclaim
I just want to be the one you love
And with your admission that you'd feel the same
I'll have reached the goal I'm dreaming of, believe me
I don't want to set the world on fire
I just want to start a flame in your heart
